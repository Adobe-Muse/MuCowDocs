# Getting Started
Welcome to the Muse Configurable Options Widget (MuCow) documentation. Here you
will learn more about making your own HTML embed widgets that can be placed in
Muse and will include a set of user-facing configurable options. This format
will allow you to create content not currently available in Muse, and easily
share it with others in the community. Note that this feature allows you to
create **HTML embed widgets** &mdash; not "standard" widgets like Slideshows
and Accordion widgets for example.

On this site, you'll find documentation for the format itself, some examples
that will help you get started, and resources for distributing your
final MuCow and getting noticed. Hopefully this will be your one-stop-shop for
writing widgets in Muse. We'll also do our best to include recommendations for
the best ways to create, debug, and optimize your widget, as well as some good
ways to share it with the community.
