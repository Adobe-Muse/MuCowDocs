# FAQ
Here are some common questions people have. If you don't see your question
here, feel free to ask it in the [forums][1] and others can help you out.

## What is a MuCow?
A MuCow is an Adobe Muse Configurable Options Widget. It is a extension format
that allows you, the user, to write your very own widgets for Muse. With this
widget, you can include a set of user configurable options that enable you to
change your behavior based on parameters to your script. A MuCow itself is
written in a simple XML format, and saved as a .mucow file format.

## Can I use jQuery?

**Yes**. You can use the version of jQuery we use by placing all script content
in [`<bodyEndHTML>`][4] tag. You can also check out our [jQuery Tutorial][5].

## How can I make one?
Simply open up your favorite text or XML editor, and follow the documentation
here. Once you're done, save it as a .mucow file, and place it into Muse.

## How do I place it?
Adding a MuCow into Muse is done in the same manner in which an image, Flash,
or Edge Animate file are added. Simply use the "File > Place" menu item, or
the keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD + D.

## What versions support it?
Different Muse versions support different MuCow formats starting with the 7.0
Muse release. See the following table for more information about which releases
support which MuCow formats

| MuCow Format | Minimum Muse Version Required |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 7.0 (Released Nov. 2013) |
| 2 | 2014.0 (Released June 2014) |
| 3 | 2014.3 (Released February 2015) |

## Where can I share it?
The recommended way to share your MuCow with others is by adding it to a
library, exporting the library, and submitting it to the [Adobe Add-on
marketplace][2]. You may also submit the .mucow file if you'd like it to be
used as an example by others who want to create their own. If you do choose to
include both, simply place the files into a .zip folder, and upload that
instead. To learn more about creating user library items please refer to
[the help page for the library panel][3]. To learn more about submitting
content to the Adobe Add-on marketplace refer to [the Add-on help page][6].
