MuCow Documentation
=====

Welcome to the documentation for Adobe Muse CC's MuCow Format.
MuCows, or Muse Configurable Options Widgets, are an extensibility format
for Adobe Muse CC, created to allow you to make HTML embed widgets of your
very own for Muse.

To get started in learning more about it, check out the 
[first chapter "Getting Started With MuCows"](./01-Getting Started.md), or view our 
[full documentation site][1] for a nicer to read format.

## Learn More

The MuCow format was added in the 7th release for Adobe Muse CC, and is an XML
format designed to allow you, the user, to create configurable HTML embed widgets
that you can use and share as you see fit. In the widget library for Muse, we
have a set of Social widgets, which include things like YouTube videos, Google
maps, Facebook Comments, and more, which are all built using this MuCow format.
Each widget can contain HTML that should be inserted into the Muse site, as 
well as a set of options that can be configured by the user to modify the final
behavior of the widget.
